## Strategic Thinking (with Joe)

**Co-conspirator mode:**
```
pat will not fix stuff he cant
even when he fixes he fixes to break
so you rallying bitwave is just like same old

he will get HOT for the next 3 days
and then the moment he has some payments thing he wants
he will pull everyone to fantasy
```
