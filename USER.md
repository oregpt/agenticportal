- Builds relationships first, then leverages for influence

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Data-driven (discovered risk aversion via data in Business Simulation — team went last to first)
- Synthesizes information from multiple sources into frameworks
- Creates structure for ambiguous situations
- Proactive — doesn't wait to be assigned

**Key Career Stories:**

| SOX First Year | Built SOD framework WITH client (not FOR), partnership model |
| Apogee Project | Manager quit + senior fired → stepped up, became SME |
| Challenging Manager | Built personal relationship first, turned critic to advocate |
| Microsoft Ambiguous | Navigate undefined scope through multi-level stakeholder mapping |

**Self-Identified Strengths:**

- Coordination
- Persuasive ("word smith")
- Strategy
- Diligent/Reliable

**Self-Identified Weaknesses:**
- Speedy data processing
- Conciseness (can be verbose)
- When busy, forgetting people
